# ICARIA NON-CONTEMPORARY COHORT: LIST OF CANDIDATES PER HF PER MONTHS AND SUMMARY REPORT 

This project runs several functions that allowed to get a list of potential non-contemporary cohort ICARIA participants that meet age criteria. A minimum number of participants per letter is needed to compare with the non-ICARIA cohort. This script is crucial to determine, daily, how many participants need to be recruited per month per HF per letter to get the minimum number of participants per month and age criteria.

Parallely, it generates a summary tool to follow this ICARIA cohort recruitment.

This script is intended to be run daily.

20231001 Completed: As ICARIA COHORT recruitment is already finished, this script is saved as completed and no other modifications are required.
